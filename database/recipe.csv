Moving it to the edge of the counter and turning the cake as it's cut makes this easier.  Take the top piece (2/3 of the cake) and turn it over onto another sheet of wax paper.  Frost the bottom piece with 1/3 of the frosting and sprinkle with 1/3 of the semi-sweet chocolate, broken into small peices.  Flip the top 2/3 of the cake that was removed back onto the frosted layer.  Cut this top layer in half and flip the top 1/3 off to the side as you did before (I found it easier to cut the top layer into thirds to make it easier to flip (since it's so thin... also these will be the lines the cake is cut along in the end so the cuts will not be visible).  Again ice the top of the cake and sprinkle with chocolate as before.  Replace the top 1/3 of the cake and ice with remaining frosting and sprinkle with remaining chocolate.  

Cut entire cake lenghwise into 3 equal peices widthwise and then cut two times along the length (you should now have 6 equal, rectangular pieces).  Finally, cut each rectangular piece from corner to corner to form 12 triangular pieces.

Since this was our own concoction I told Sammy that it needed a name and she came up with ""Mommy's Chicken and Potato Feast"".  It seemed appropriate, everyone had at least three helpings, including Sammy.

Wash the potatoes and cut them into fourths.  Put them in an 8 or 9 inch square casserole dish with the 1 tbl butter, basil and oregano and cook them on high in the microwave until done.  This took about 10 minutes in our overachieving microwave.  Make sure you stop it and stir the potatoes around a few times so that they cook evenly.

While the potatoes are cooking cut the chicken into fairly large long chunks.  Heat up the pan with 1 tbl butter (might need 2 depending on your pan).  Cook the chicken in the pan until cooked through and nicely browned.  

While the potatoes and chicken are cooking you need to make the sauce.  Add the wine, lemon juice and garlic to a small pot and reduce for 3 minutes.  Add the cream and sage and cook for another 2 minutes or until bubbling again.  Finally, add the butter and whisk until it is all combined.

When the chicken and potatoes have finished cooking, add the chicken to the casserole dish.  Pour the sauce over the chicken and potatoes and serve.  

I am thinking that if you had the time it would be nice to just brown the chicken and partly cook the potatoes and then put them together and let them cook in the sauce for a while in the oven.  I haven't tried that yet, if someone does, let me know how it comes out :-)",,Michelle Higgins

Makes two 10 inch pizzas.  I like to add some oregano and basil to the dough when you are doing the first mix to add some flavor.",,Michelle Higgins
107,Auntie Anne's Pretzels,Miscellaneous,"1. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a small bowl or cup.  Let it sit for a few minutes.
2. Combine the flour, powdered sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add water with yeast and vegetable oil. Stir with a spoon and then use your hands to form the dough into a ball.  Knead the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover it and store it in a warm place for about 45 minutes or until the dough doubles in size.
3. When dough has risen, preheat oven to 425 degrees.
4. Make a bath for the pretzels by combining the baking soda with the warm water and stir until baking soda is mostly dissolved.
5. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into 8 even portions.  Roll each portion on a flat non-floured surface until it is about 3 feet long. Pick up both ends of the dough and give it a little spin so the middle of the dough spins around once.  Lay the dough down with the loop nearest to you.  Fold the ends down toward you and pinch to attch them to the bottom of the loop.  The twist should be in the middle and it should look like a pretzel.  We have also just cut them into bite sizes which works really well for finger snacks.
6. Holding the pinched ends, dip each pretzel into the bath solution.  Put each pretzel on a paper towel for a moment to blot the excess liquid.  Arrange the pretzels on a baking sheet sprayed with non-stick spray.  If you want salt, sprinkle pretzels with kosher or pretzel salt.  Don't salt any pretzels you plan to coat with cinnamon/sugar. You will likely have to use two baking sheets, and be sure to bake them separately.  Bake the pretzels for 4 minutes, then spin the pan halfway around and bake for another 4 to 5 minutes or until the pretzels are golden brown.
7. Remove the pretzels from the oven and let them cool for a couple of minutes.  If you want to eat some now, brush with melted butter first, if desired, before serving.  If you want the cinnamon/sugar coating, make it by combining the 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon in a small bowl.  Brush the unsalted pretzels with a generous amount of melted butter.  Sprinkle a heavy coating of the cinnamon/sugar onto the entire surface of the pretzels over a plate.  Munch out.

108,Lemon Butter for Plank Chicken,Sauce,"This is the recipe that use with plank chicken, but it's also tasty for anytime you want a lemon butter sauce.

Reduce the wine and lemon juice with the shallots (you can use garlic if you don't have shallots) for 2 minutes. Add the cream and reduce for 2 minutes.  Using a whisk, slowly encorporate the butter.  Season with pepper to taste.",,Michelle Higgins
109,Plank chicken,Entree,"Soak planks for at least 1 hour in water.

Preheat grill.

Mix together all the seasonings in a small bowl.  

Cut potatoes into small cubes and put in a small casserole dish with the butter and some of the seasonings.  Cook in the microwave for 2 minutes, then stir.  Repeat cooking for 2 minutes and stirring until they start to soften.  If you don't stir often they will not cook evenly.

Cut chicken breasts into strips, about 3 per breast.  Coat the chicken in the seasoning mix.

When the potatoes are done, remove the planks from the water.  Arrange the chicken and potatoes on the planks so that the pieces of chicken do not touch each other.  

Put the planks on the grill and cook with the cover down for about 20 minutes.  While the chicken is cooking, make the ""Lemon Butter for Plank Chicken"" recipe found under sauces.  When the chicken is done, serve on the planks with the sauce.

You can also experiment with adding other vegetables or meats.  I have tried this with steak or shrimp and it works well.  Adding onions, zuchinni, peppers or any other veg works well.  If the veg takes a long time to cook like potatoes or carrots, then you need to cook them ahead of time before putting them on the plank.

111,Apple Pancakes,Breakfast,"1. In a large bowl combine butter, egg, milk and apple.  In a separate bowl combine all dry ingredients.  Stir dry ingredients into the wet ones.  Cook like normal pancakes.

*Note - if making lactose free pancakes, the egg substitute and silk make them too chewy.  Add some water to thin the mix so that they will spread out - or I'd like to try replacing the egg substitute with oil instead to see if that makes them cook better.",,Michelle Higgins
112,Chili,Entree,"In a large pan cook beef, onion and green pepper until meat is browned.  Drain if necessary.  Add kidney beans with the juice, tomatoes with the juice and all other ingredients.  Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes or longer.  

Note - We like a LOT of chili powder.  More conservative tastes may wish to start at 2 tsp and work their way up.",,Michelle Higgins
113,Chicken and Orange Casserole,Entree,"If using full chickens, trim the fat and remove the skin, then cut each chicken into 8 pieces and discard the backbones.  If using chicken breasts, trim the fat and cut each breast into 3 or 4 pieces.

Heat a teaspoon of olive oil in a large, deep, heavy based pan.  Add the bacon and cook over medium heat for 2-3 minutes or until just crisp.  Remove from the pan and set on paper towels to drain.  Add the remaining oil and 2 tbl butter to the pan.  Add onions to pan and cook until dark golden brown - stirring often to keep them browning evenly.  Remove onions from pan and set aside.

Add the chicken pieces to the pan and brown over medium heat.  Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.  

Add the remaining butter to the pan.  Stir in the garlic, ginger, orange rind, cumin, cardamom and honey.  Cook, stirring for one minute.  Add the orange juice, wine and chicken stock to the pan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Return the chicken pieces, onions, bacon to the pan and add the carrots.  Cook until the carrots are tender - 15 to 20 minutes.  

*Notes - I added about a tablespoon of gravy flour to thicken the sauce.  The original version of this recipe adds only the chicken back into the sauce at first, cooks covered for 40 minutes, then adds the onions and bacon back in and cooks for another 15 minutes, covered.  Then they add in the carrots and cook until they are tender.  I have never tried this because I never have that kind of time, so it might be awesome.  My version takes about an hour less to cook and there are no leftovers.  I also note that I specify the type of orange juice.  This recipe wasn't sponsored by Minute Maid, it's just that I find Tropicana far too bitter to use in a sauce.  I also find that the low acid version is much easier on everyone's stomach.",,Michelle Higgins

Press dough into a greased 8 inch round cake pan and then flip over onto parchment paper.  Cut the dough into 8 wedges (like a pizza).
Put wedges on parchment paper on a cookie sheet, and bake 12-15 minutes until tops are golden brown.

**Notes- OK, that's the official version of how to put them on the pan. Personally I find that with 1 cup of liquid the dough is way too wet to do this with.  I have added more flour or cut back on the liquid to make it possible to form them, but as it turns out the scones don't taste quite as good. So instead I just roll out the parchment paper and spoon six globs onto it.  I flatten out the globs with my fingers and sprinkle some sugar on top before baking.  My friend Val also uses an ice cream scoop to put out nice little blobs and that works well too.",,Michelle Higgins
